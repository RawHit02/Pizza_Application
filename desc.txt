Configuration are never be the part of the code

Challenges between frntend and backend server connectivity

1>  Network call (Async Calls)
2> JSON(Serilization and DeSerilization)
  - Convert Object into JSON (Serilization)
  - JSON into Object (Deserilization)
3> Data (Object) -> HTML
  - DOM (Document object Model) ,we have to make (Dynamic HTML)
4> Async VS Sync
5> JS internal Architecture


Event Loop - reads all the code of a JS file which is stored in Queue
two conditions occur here 1> Sync 2> Async
CPU centric work - fast work is done by non blocking
if a data is heavy it get stored in thread for later process and it take some time 

Sync - > waiting is less and we get less tim result with time
Async -> Possibility is promise but  it takes more time to come into the Queue
 

promise - 3 states 1. Pending
                   2. Fulfilled
                   3. Rejected
Controller is the layer Between HTML and Logics (logics) are under the servers
controller is used for loosely coupling so that changes an be done easily in code

await - it is keyword which will wait the further decision for the async data to come and then sync the data 
await - async wait it is the fully promised data who wait till the data not get it it is fast process

MVP - Minimal vibal product
MVC - Model View Controller (it is a design pattern) - it do Segregate of functions


HTML(document) ->  DOM(Document object model)   -> JS(object) 



Basket Functionality
A>Add to  button function then bind it with the code
B> now add function




objects are in memory it provide data to the memory 



1> News API
2> Music store
